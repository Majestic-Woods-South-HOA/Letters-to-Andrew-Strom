As of December 5, 2024, The board of Majestic Woods South Homeowner's Association refuses to cooperate with my inquiry requests for information.
The board consists of President J. Andrew Strom, Treasurer Tom Byrne and Secretary Nancy Byrne.

Homeowners’ associations (HOAs) are entrusted with managing shared community resources and enforcing governing documents to maintain property values and community harmony. However, when an HOA fails to operate transparently and accountably, it can lead to mistrust, financial mismanagement, and erosion of community cohesion. In such cases, it is essential to take corrective action to restore the HOA’s compliance with its governing documents, state laws, and federal regulations.
